# GiveBack - A Hackathon App

GiveBack is a peer-to-peer money transfer service application that allows users to give back while receiving rewards. All while on the blockchain.

I was tasked with the blockchain functionality of our application. This repo allows a user to sign into their wallet,
send money to another account, and see their transactions on a
Blockchain ledger.
